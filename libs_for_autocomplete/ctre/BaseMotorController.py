                    The robot API holds a "top buffer" of trajectory points, so your applicaion
                    can dump several points at once.  The API will then stream them into the
                    low-level buffer, allowing the motor controller to act on them.
        
                    topBufferRem: The number of points in the top trajectory buffer.
        
                    btledBufferCnt: The number of points in the low level controller buffer.
        
                    hasUnderrun: 	Set if isUnderrun ever gets set.
                    Can be manually cleared by ClearMotionProfileHasUnderrun() or automatically cleared by StartMotionProfile().
        
                    isUnderrun:		This is set if controller needs to shift a point from its buffer into
                    the active trajectory point however
                    the buffer is empty.
                    This gets cleared automatically when is resolved.
        
                    activePointValid:	True if the active trajectory point is not empty, false otherwise. The members in activePoint are only valid if this signal is set.
        
                    isLast:	is set/cleared based on the MP executer's current
                    trajectory point's IsLast value.  This assumes
                    IsLast was set when PushMotionProfileTrajectory

                    selected slot.  This can differ in the currently selected slot used
                    for Position and Velocity servo modes
        
                    outputEnable:		The current output mode of the motion profile
                    executer (disabled, enabled, or hold).  When changing the set()
                    value in MP mode, it's important to check this signal to
                    confirm the change takes effect before interacting with the top buffer.

        This must be called periodically to funnel the trajectory points from the

        Simple one-shot firing of a complete MP.
        Starting in 2019, MPs can be fired by building a Buffered Trajectory Point Stream, and calling this routine.
        
        Once called, the motor controller software will automatically ...
        [1] Clear the firmware buffer of trajectory points.
        [2] Clear the underrun flags
        [3] Reset an index within the Buffered Trajectory Point Stream (so that the same profile can be run again and again).
        [4] Start a background thread to manage MP streaming (if not already running).
        [5a] If current control mode already matches motionProfControlMode, set MPE Output to "Hold".
        [5b] If current control mode does not matches motionProfControlMode, apply motionProfControlMode and set MPE Output to "Disable".
        [6] Stream the trajectory points into the device's firmware buffer.
        [7] Once motor controller has at least minBufferedPts worth in the firmware buffer, MP will automatically start (MPE Output set to "Enable").
        [8] Wait until MP finishes, then transitions the Motion Profile Executor's output to "Hold".
        [9] IsMotionProfileFinished() will now return true.
        
        Calling application can use IsMotionProfileFinished() to determine when internal state machine reaches [7].
        Calling application can cancel MP by calling set().  Otherwise do not call set() until MP has completed.
        
        The legacy API from previous years requires the calling application to pass points via the ProcessMotionProfileBuffer and PushMotionProfileTrajectory.
        This is no longer required if using this StartMotionProfile/IsMotionProfileFinished API.

                             Recommendation value for this would be five to ten samples depending on timeDur of the trajectory point.
